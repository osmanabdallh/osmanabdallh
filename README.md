I'm a recent Software Engineering graduate from Sudan with a strong passion for building mobile and web applications.

I have hands-on experience developing real-world projects, including:
- A recipe app (Android, Java, Firebase)
- A full inventory management system (Laravel PHP backend + REST API + Android app)

My focus is on writing clean code, learning fast, and solving real problems.  
I’m currently looking for remote opportunities in Android development, Laravel backend, or full-stack junior roles.
